# Activity-6
Implement the following scheduling algorithms using Arduino or TinkerCAD. 

# First in first out
> LED 1 - 1s |
> LED 2 - 1s |
> LED 3 - 1s |
> LED 4 - 1s |
> LED 5 - 1s |
> LED 6 - 1s |

LED1 lights up or 1s, LED2 for 1s, LED3 for 1s, LED4 for 1s, LED5 for 1s, LED6 for 1s, and the loop terminates

# Round robin
6 LEDs in a round robin
5 rounds
> round 1: LED 1 and 2 | 3 and 6 | 4 and 5

> round 2: LED 3 and 4 | 6 and 1 | 2 and 5

> round 3: LED 6 and 4 | 2 and 3 | 1 and 5

> round 4: LED 4 and 1 | 5 and 3 | 6 and 2

> round 5: LED 5 and 6 | 1 and 3 | 4 and 2

# Shortest job first
